### Introduction.

This project is one of many Javascript project to be completed by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) students.


### How to play

At the start of the game, the player enters his name. The player is then redirected to the game menu, the player can click play or any of the options provided. The player will be taken to the game main scene if the play button is clicked where there are platforms which is arranged randomely. The player needs to consume all the star on the platforms by jumping and and walking. Player can move the playing character by using the Down, Up, Left and Right keys on the keyboard. The player will need to avoid all bouncing bombs which will increase in number anytime the player is able to consume all the stars on the platforms.

### Project Objectives

The first 2 days was exploring Phaser.js framework through tutorials and readings. Following by sourcing for sprites and images on [openart](https://opengameart.org/). I wanted simple game mechanics to give players the perception of endless running by panning the camera instead having random spawning moving platforms across the screen. To accummulate points, player will need to collect start worth 10 points and avoid the bombs. For that I had to stretch sky background image several times to achieve a long stage.
